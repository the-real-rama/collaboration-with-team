Creating User Stories:
====================
I follow a structured approach to creating user stories. I start by gathering requirements through stakeholder interviews, workshops, and analyzing healthcare documentation. I then break these requirements into smaller, manageable user stories.

Each user story follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]." For example, "As a nurse, I want to access patient records quickly so that I can provide timely care." This ensures clarity and focus on the user's perspective. I also include acceptance criteria to define when the story is complete, helping the development team understand the scope.

Additionally, I define testing scenarios within the acceptance criteria to ensure Development and QA consider all scenarios. By providing detailed information, I make sure the user story is successful.

For larger projects, I create EPICs, which are high-level user stories that capture broad requirements. EPICs are broken down into smaller user stories for incremental development and testing.

I prioritize user stories based on business value, urgency, and healthcare regulations, and continuously refine them through feedback and collaboration with stakeholders and the development team. This iterative process helps deliver a product that aligns with user needs and healthcare goals.


Agile Product Owner/Business Analyst:
==========================
In my role as an Agile Product Owner/Business Analyst, I host kickoff meetings with the development and QA teams, as well as the manager, to present user stories and address any queries they may have. 
I attend daily standups to answer additional questions that arise during the development phase. I also participate in meetings for incremental demos to review progress and gather feedback. 

After development is complete, I collaborate with the QA team to test the features thoroughly. Once a feature is completed, I attend retrospectives to discuss what went well, what didn't, and how we can improve moving forward.

Additionally, I regularly collaborate with clients and stakeholders to understand their priorities and preferences, and I present features after they are deployed to QA environments to ensure alignment with their expectations.
I maintain the product backlog, ensuring it is up-to-date and reflects the current priorities and requirements. 

I facilitate communication between the development team and stakeholders to ensure everyone is aligned on the project goals and progress. By continuously refining user stories and acceptance criteria based on feedback, I help ensure that the final product meets the users' needs and business objectives.


SAFe experience:
================
I have extensive experience in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), I have been deeply involved in gathering and analyzing requirements, designing features, and creating detailed user stories with acceptance criteria. I actively participated in Program Increment (PI) planning sessions to align multiple Agile teams on objectives and prioritize features. 

During sprints, I collaborated closely with developers and the QA team to address questions, define testing scenarios, and ensure thorough testing of features. I attended incremental demos to review progress and gather feedback, and participated in retrospectives to discuss improvements. 

To measure success and ensure continuous improvement, I used various metrics and measures, including:

Velocity: Tracking the team's capacity to deliver work within a sprint.
Burn-down Charts: Monitoring progress towards sprint goals.
Cycle Time: Measuring the time taken to complete a user story from start to finish.
Defect Density: Tracking the number of defects found during testing to ensure quality.
Customer Satisfaction: Gathering feedback from stakeholders and end-users to assess the effectiveness of delivered features.


JIRA/Confluence:
===============
I have extensive experience using JIRA and Confluence to manage projects and collaborate with teams effectively. In JIRA, I create and manage user stories, tasks, and bugs, ensuring they are well-documented and prioritized according to business needs. 
I assign tasks to the respective team members and use JIRA's workflow capabilities to track the progress of tasks through various stages, from backlog to completion. I generate reports to monitor team performance and project status, and configure dashboards to provide real-time visibility into key metrics and project health.

In Confluence, I create and maintain comprehensive documentation, including requirement specifications, meeting notes, and project plans. I attach screenshots, data structures, diagrams, links to relevant information, product knowledge, vision and roadmap, and meeting notes to ensure all necessary details are captured. 
I also use it to collaborate with stakeholders and team members by sharing documents, gathering feedback, and maintaining a centralized knowledge base. This helps ensure that everyone has access to the latest information and can contribute to the project's success.


Transactional Data Experience:
==========================
I worked with transactional data, which involves handling large volumes of data generated from business transactions. I collected data from various sources, including databases, ERP systems, CRM systems, SharePoint, spreadsheets, and cloud platforms, using tools like SSIS for extraction. 

I ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data through data cleaning and validation processes, transforming it as needed before loading it into data warehouses or databases. I then use tools like Power BI and Tableau to create detailed dashboards and reports, providing valuable insights to stakeholders. 

Throughout this process, I ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards, such as HIPAA, to protect sensitive information and maintain data security. Additionally, I collaborate with cross-functional teams, including IT, finance, and operations, to ensure that transactional data is effectively utilized to support business objectives


Medicare Provider Enrollment:
=========================
I have successfully managed Medicare provider enrollment projects, achieving reduction in application processing times. I ensured strict compliance with CMS regulations by conducting regular audits and updating procedures as needed. 

I developed and maintained comprehensive databases to accurately track enrollment status, and implemented robust data validation checks that reduced errors. My role involved close collaboration with IT, legal, and operations teams to seamlessly integrate enrollment systems, enhancing overall efficiency.

Additionally, I provided extensive training sessions for staff on Medicare enrollment guidelines, ensuring they were well-versed in the latest procedures and regulations. I also created detailed support documents to assist staff in navigating the enrollment process. 
To drive continuous improvement, I monitored key performance indicators such as days to final bill, days to payment, claims acceptance/rejection rates, claims denial rate, payment amounts, reimbursement rate, coder productivity, volume of coder questions, and requests for additional information.
